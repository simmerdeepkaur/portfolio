						<p class="lead">I am a multimedia journalist at the Redwood City Pulse and a recent graduate of UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. I am passionate about reporting unconventional yet significant news stories that deserve the world’s recognition. My odyssey into the world of journalism started as an undergraduate, working as a part of my university’s editorial team and interning at several newsrooms in North India. After coming to Berkeley, I was determined to reinvent myself and go beyond writing! In the past three years I have acquired data skills by learning Python, R, and tools for visualizations, to be a strong supplemental tool for my stories. These skills help me balance covering breaking news and enterprise stories while delivering scoops at the Pulse. 
</p>

                        <p class="lead">Through it all, I have produced reportage covering a wide variety of topics. Now I can don multiple hats - reporter, writer, podcaster, data-analyst, with an endless quest to tackle new challenges and never stay inside my comfort zone!</p>

            <li>Produced and edited five episodes using Adobe Audition.</li>
            <li>Structured the episodes by writing interview questions and drafting scripts.</li>

                                <li>Reported a story about the Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine group that led the protests for UC Berkeley to divest from the war. The story shines a light on how the group was inspired to start the protest and the series of creative protests they held at the University's South entrance. It further leans into the group's demands and how the University has responded to them. </li>
                                <li>Interviewed the spokesperson of the group and UC Berkeley's Assistant Vice Chancellor Dan Mogulof.</li>

                        <li>As the Executive Producer, I picked the stories to be featured on the show. Worked with the reporters on editing the stories and ensured the highest possible standard of content production. I also guaranteed the audio files were organized and everything went according to plan when we went live.
</li> 
                        <li>Reported a story about Berkeley’s Citizen Clinic that is providing free cybersecurity services to nonprofits facing the threat of being politically targeted, thereby saving them up to $150,000 on IT services. The clinic was recently backed by Google and received $500,000 in funding and additional volunteer support from experts at Google. The time stamp for my story is ‘3:40 - 8:09.’ 
                        </li>
                        <li>As the newscaster, I presented the latest news from the Bay Area live. The first story focuses on the encampment at Berkeley that Palestinian protestors set up to demand the university’s divestment from the war. The second story is about the California State Senate’s plan to provide unemployment benefits to striking workers. 
The time stamp for the newscast is ‘1:05 - 2:50.’

                          <li>Covered the debut of North America’s first hydrogen-powered garbage truck in San Mateo County, as California moves toward a zero-emission future.</li>

			  <li>Spoke with an energy-conversion expert at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to break down the complex mechanics of hydrogen fuel cells for a general audience.</li>
