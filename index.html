						<p class="lead">I am a multimedia journalist at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism and am passionate about reporting unconventional yet significant news stories that deserve the world’s recognition. But my odyssey into the world of journalism started as an undergraduate, working as a part of my university’s editorial team and interning at several newsrooms in North India. After coming to Berkeley, I was determined to reinvent myself and go beyond writing! In the past three years I have acquired data skills by learning python, R and tools for visualizations, to be a strong supplemental tool for my enterprise stories. 

Through it all, I have produced stories covering a wide variety of topics.
Now I can don multiple hats - podcaster, writer, reporter, data analyst, with an endless quest to tackle new challenges and never stay inside my comfort zone!

                      <p>Wrote a long-form narrative story about the journey of two exiled women journalists as they fly across the world in an attempt to escape the Taliban’s extremist rule and save their lives, but at the cost of never being able to go back home. I also collected and analyzed data from the Committee to Protect Journalists to  find out the total number of journalists executed in Afghanistan, and compared this number to journalist killings in other nations. At the bottom of the story, I created a map that shows Khwaga Ghani’s entire journey before she ended in the Bay.

                      <p>Wrote a profile story about Marlena Robbins, a doctoral student at Berkeley, working on making psychedelic assisted therapy more accessible to the indigenous communities. I also made an augmented reality component as a fun-interactive multimedia element to induce more engagement. I made the AR experience using Blippar software. At the end of the story, there is QR code for the readers to scan. It takes you to a forest setting and provides information on the different types of psychedelic mushrooms and where they can be found in the US.

                      <p>Covered a story about the impacts of last year’s heat wave on international students at Berkeley when the extreme weather took a toll on the academic front for many due to escalated anxiety levels induced by insufficient sleep, reduced concentration and physical distress. The story captures the struggles of the international students at UCB and, at the same time, shines a light on the bigger picture of climate change.

                      <p> Covered this story when the Oakland City Council decided to end its eviction moratorium by talking to the city council members, both tenants and landlords, and attending the council meetings. The Oakland City Council voted 7-1 to sunset the COVID-19 eviction moratorium on July 15, introducing a comprehensive ordinance that combines the expiration with permanent tenant protections. Authored by Council President Nikki Fortunato Bas and Council President Pro Tempore Dan Kalb, the ordinance addresses housing instability, drawing both support and opposition. Tenant concerns about potential evictions clashed with landlords seeking resolution for outstanding debts.</p>

                      <p>Covered this cultural story when Alameda County celebrated its 15th annual Lunar New Year event with a heartwarming return to in-person festivities at Lincoln Hall. The program was the first since the pandemic lockdown in 2020, featured five traditional performances that beautifully showcased the diverse Asian communities in the Bay Area. Approximately 400 attendees, predominantly children from eight schools, gathered in person, while students from nine other schools joined virtually. The event, marked by cultural richness and community spirit, provided a joyful respite, bringing people together to celebrate the Lunar New Year and embrace the diverse heritage of the Bay Area. I interviewed Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson, some performers and the school children and teachers. I also took pictures of the various performances throughout the event, as can be seen in the coverage.
